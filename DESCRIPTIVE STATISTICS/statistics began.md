When Statistics Began

* The **basic idea of statistics** started in **ancient civilizations** such as **Babylon, Egypt, China, and Rome**.
  They used counting and record-keeping for:

  * Population censuses
  * Land measurement
  * Tax collection

* **Modern statistics** is generally considered to have begun in **1662**, when **John Graunt** analyzed **London’s Bills of Mortality**.
  His work studied:

  * Birth rates
  * Death rates
  * Life expectancy

* The word **“statistics”** comes from words meaning **“state”**:

  * Latin: *status*
  * Italian: *statista*
  * German: *Statistik*

  It was popularized around **1749** by **Gottfried Achenwall**, who described statistics as the **science of the state**.

## 🏛️ Where Statistics Was First Used

* Statistics was first widely used by **governments** for:

  * Population censuses
  * Tax records
  * Land surveys
  * Measuring military strength

  Because of this, it was known as the **“science of statecraft.”**

* During the **17th and 18th centuries**, statistics expanded into:

  * **Demography** – studying population, mortality, and life tables
    (John Graunt, Edmund Halley)
  * **Probability theory** – developed through games of chance
    (Pascal, Fermat, Huygens, Bernoulli, de Moivre)
    This formed the **mathematical foundation** of statistics.
